Handling multiple windows:
    In order to handle multiple windows we will be using:

        getWindowHandle();
        getWindowHandles();

    Window Handle:
        Window handle is a unique ID that holds the address of the window or the tab
        It is approximately a 40 alphanumeric character ID

    Synchronization:
        It is the process of bringing the speed of two or more components to the same level
        in this case we are bringing our script and page load to the same speed level

        Thread.sleep();---> static wait / unconditional wait

        Types of Selenium waits:

            1.Implicit
                Tells the webdriver to wait for a certain amount of time before throwing an exception
                It will be written only once and will be applied for the whole session of the execution
                We can say the implicit wait is a global wait

                Implicit wait is ussually set to 20 seconds. If your element is found any time before the given time
                the rest of the time will be ignored and your script will move on to the next action

                If the element is not found within the given time only then will you get a no such element exception
            2.Explicit
            3.Fluent
