        8 locators in selenium

        ID
        Name
        ClassName
        TagName
        CSS
        Xpath
        LinkText
        PartialLinkText

        HTML Scripting meaning:
        purple -- tags
        brown or orange -- attributes
        blue -- attribute value

        Why do we need so many locators?
            Some locators might have duplicate values
            Developers might not provide all the locators for the same element
            Some locators nay not be applicable to all the elements
            e.g. lintext partialLinText are only used for links

         "a" tag in HTML is called anchor tag.
         If 2 or more elements have same attributes and attribute values Selenium will only see the first one and
         will only interact with the first element
