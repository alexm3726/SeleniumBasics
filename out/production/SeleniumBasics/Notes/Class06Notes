Alerts:
    Alert is a pop up message. Alert takes complete focus of our main page that we are working on.
    We cannot proceed until it is handled.

    3 types of Alerts:

        1. Web based Alerts/ HTML alerts ---> we can simple inspect and perform needed actions
        2. Javascript alerts/ browser alerts ---> we can handle these alerts by using the switchTo() method
                                                  We cannot inspect

           Types of JS Alerts:
                   1. Simple Alert- click ok
                   2. Confirmation Alert- either cancel or click ok
                   3. Prompt Alert- enter text then click ok
           To handle JS Alerts we only have 4 methods:
                   1. accept()
                   2. dismiss()
                   3. getText()
                   4. sendKeys()

        3. windows based alerts ---> we cannot handle these alerts with selenium


Interview Question:

    How do you handle an alert in selenium?
    We use the Alert Interface



Frames
    Frame is a separate independent window in our webpage
    Frames allow devs to present multiple views in one page

    3 ways to interact with frames:
    1. By index
    2. By name or id
    3. by web element

    In alerts- switch to alert manually and switch back automatically
    In frames- switch to frame manually and switch back to default content manually
